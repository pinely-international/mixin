[Mixin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin)s are the type of structure in software development that allows them be included in a more composition way rather than inheritance.
The closest analogy is if `class User implements Person, Profile { }` would actually implement the properties and methods.

As `implements` is a TypeScript feature, it doesn't exist in runtime, that's why this library relies on `extends` behavior.
Though it still looks readable - `class User extends mixin(Person, Profile) { }`.

This library tries to achieve more native feeling, like `mixin` is actually a part of JavaScript/TypeScript. This library includes only one method `mixin`, the rest is done via plain JavaScript.

## Install

```bash
bun i class-mixin-instance
```

## Example

```ts
import { mixin } from "class-mixin-instance"

class Person {
  name!: string
  age!: number

  private gender!: "aircraft"
}

class Profile {
  name!: string
  avatar!: string

  protected something!: {}
}

export class User extends mixin(Person, Profile) {
  id!: number

  asd() {
    this.gender // => Error: Property is private
    this.something
  }
}


const user = new User
user.gender // => Error: Property is private
user.something // => Error: Property is protected

user instanceof User // === true
user instanceof Person // === true
user instanceof Profile // === true
user instanceof mixin(Person, Profile) // === true
```

## Specification

- a mixin class can define properties and methods.
- a mixin class can define public/protected/private visibility.
- a mixin class can define a constructor.
- a mixin class can't define constructor arguments.
- a mixin doesn't have to be extended.
- mixin classes types must match each other, otherwise error will be shown at `extends mixin(Person, Profile)`.
- a class that extends a mixin can be checked with `instanceof` for each class and altogether.

### Type per class

When inspecting a property from a mixin, your IDE will display what this type belongs to.

### Type `super`

When inspecting `super`, your IDE will display the mixins.

### Semantics

To annotate that a class should be used as a Mixin, a `@mixin.member` decorator can be used on a desired class.
Though it doesn't restrict a class from being invocated as a regular class.

```ts
@mixin.member
class Profile {}

new Profile // No error.
new mixin(Profile) // Works the same.
```

> [!TIP]
> Using `@mixin.member` also provides better performance, this is due to JS limitations of defining `Symbol.hasInstance`. Using `@mixin.member` puts necessary static properties that otherwise is done on first `mixin(Member)` call, you're essentially partially initiating a Mixin before it's used.

```ts
@mixin.member
class Profile1 {}

// No decorator
class Profile2 {}

mixin(Profile1) // Faster.
mixin(Profile2)
```

> [!Note]
> If you really want to tell that it should be used only as base class you can prefix it with `abstract`, which will allow TypeScript to display an error whenever it's used on its own.

```ts
@mixin.member
abstract class Profile {}

new Profile // TypeScript error.
new mixin(Profile) // Works the same.
```

## Decorators

Decorators should work as intended.

```ts
const META = Symbol("meta")
function mark(kind: string) {
  return (target: any, prop: string) => {
    target[META] ??= []
    target[META].push(`${kind}-${prop}`)
  }
}

class Alpha {
  @mark("alpha") foo!: string
}

class Beta {
  @mark("beta") bar!: string
}

class Both extends mixin(Alpha, Beta) {}
console.log(Both.prototype[META]) // => ["alpha-foo","beta-bar"]
```

Decorated members with the same name from different classes are all
preserved, the mixed prototype simply contains both pieces of metadata.

## Standalone Invocation

`mixin(A, B, C)` can be invoked itself as a class, which would result in an object that shares `A`, `B`, `C` classes.

```ts
const abc = new mixin(A, B, C)

// Or

const ABC = mixin(A, B, C)
const abc = new ABC
```

## Notes on implementation

- `mixin` **generates a new class on the first invocation** for the provided constructors and caches the result. Subsequent calls with the same sequence return the **same** class reference, so `instanceof` checks against the same instance for same mixin classes (order doesn't matter).
- Caching relies on `CompositeMap`, which uses BitWise Keys Composition, it's the fastest approach for `CompositeMap`, but the speed works up to 32 mixin variants. When 32 variants are exceeded, it starts using `BigInt`, which creates overhead.
- When a mixed class is created, its prototype is constructed immediately by copying all properties (including symbol keys) from each base class. This ensures any metadata created by decorators lives on the mixed prototype as well.
- Static members and other non‑prototype properties from each mixin are also copied to the resulting class. Fields declared outside the constructor are handled by instantiating each base and merging its own instance properties into `this`.
- The act of overriding `instanceof` itself declines the performance by 5x, but it falls within acceptable performance for low-level operations (1ns ~ 50ns) and future engine optimizations may improve if significantly.

## Performance

### Instantiating (e.g. `new User`)

The performance is proportional to instantiating each mixin class on its own + Mixin class itself.

If class `A`, `B`, `C` Takes 30ns to initiate (10ns for each),
Then `class extends mixin(A, B, C)` Takes 40ns to initiate (10ns for each mixin class + 10ns mixin itself).

However, it can be as performant as invocating a regular non-mixin class,
it heavily depends on amount of classes, properties/methods in classes and conditions
(e.g. if `new mixin(A, B, C)` was already initiated before, it would be ~50x faster next time because of caching and JS Engine optimizations).

### Accessing properties/methods (e.g. `user.login()`)

The performance is somewhat equal as if there is no `mixin`, deviation within the error limits.

### `instanceof`

To property talk about performance of `instanceof`, let's create a baseline for it:

```ts
class Base {}
class Derived extends Base {}

new Derived instanceof Base // <== This is a baseline.
```

Let's say `new Derived instanceof Base` in that plain JavaScript takes `0.02ms`.

Then the measurements would for custom `mixin` behavior are:

```ts
class Mixed extends mixin(A, B, C) {}
const mixed = new Mixed
```

- `mixed instanceof Mixed` takes `~0.40ms`.
- `mixed instanceof C` takes `~0.15ms`.
- `mixed instanceof mixin(A, B, C)` takes `~0.75ms`.

## Development

### Running tests

```bash
bun test
```

### Benchmarking with `mitata`

The benchmark compares instantiation and method-call performance between a normal class that `extends` a single base and one produced by the `mixin` helper. The base classes include properties, symbols and decorators to approximate a real-world workload.

To run the benchmark:

```bash
bun i
bun bench
```
